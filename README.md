# Argentinian Citizenship Study Guide

> A very biased guide.

"Argentina" ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· means "made of silver" ("argentum" is silver in Latin).

We speak Spanish with an Italian accent. Some also speak English. Most people are descended from Italians or Spanish because many came here during or after World War II. We inherited many of their traditions and slang words; we use hand gestures a lot and, in general, like to be around family and friends.

Most people are Christian.
 
Nearly 50 million people live here. Like Canada, we're big and scarcely populated. Unlike Canada, our weather is pretty good.

Our national anthem is beautiful, [go listen to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqBC3l7i7dk).

We are friends with our neighbors: Uruguay, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Some are angry with Chile because they didn't support us during the Falklands war.

## History

### Before 1991

We have a bit of influence from the British, who tried to build a rail network in the country, and most of the stations remain in place today.

We originally were ruled by Spain but we got independence in 1816.

The country was relatively stable until Juan PerÃ³n became President in 1946 and then shit hit the fan because people started expecting free stuff from the government. We haven't recovered from this way of thinking and to this day many people rely on government money. 

We had military dictatorships between 1976 and 1983 where many people went missing or were killed.

In 1982 we went to war with England for the Falklands islands, which are very tiny and very empty but they have oil. We lost the war.
### After 1991

In 2001 we had a huge crisis with unemployment, riots and people killed. People were not allowed to take out their savings from the bank. To this day people do not trust the banks, or the currency. A lot of people hold their life savings in physical USD bills.

From 2003 to 2015 the country was governed by Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Kirchner. Both were accused of corruption but only the latter was formally found guilty in 2022.

## Economy

Agriculture supports our country. We export a lot of corn, wheat, soy, and wine. 

We have to import pretty much everything. 

We have both private and public schools, and private and public healthcare. In general, private is best. The exception is universities, where public universities are better than private ones.

Our currency is called "peso" and roughly 1 USD = 300 pesos but this changes literally every single day. Inflation rate is at an all-time high at 100% per year. If you have USD there, you're basically rich.

## Symbols

Mate is the national drink and we share it with friends & family. We share one straw. It's very COVID-friendly (not)

Our food relies on Italian and Spanish dishes, cow meat (not pork), and pastries. We don't use spices.

Most houses have a special grill to cook meat in it.

There's a province in Argentina, Cordoba, that is famous for drinking "fernet", a bitter spirit that was brought here by Italians. It's mixed with Coca Cola.

## Sports

Football is the most popular by far. We won 2 FIFA World Cups:

- Argentina 1978 (which was arranged by the military dictatorship at the time) 
- Mexico 1986

## People



Who we are known for:

- Diego Armando Maradona, football, he beat England in the 1986 World Cup with the "hand of God" (controversial)
- Lionel Messi, football, he's the best.

Several levels down:

- Manuel Ginobili, basketball, he got us the gold medal in the Olympics
- Quino, author of a comic book about a little girl called Mafalda
- Eva Peron, the wife of Juan Peron, we even have a musical about her ("Evita") with Madonna in it
- Jorge Luis Borges, very famous author
- Pope Francis 

## Music

Tango is famous for being born here but most people don't listen to it anymore.

We have good rock music. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZU5DGR2xCSH?si=a9ba9906712c4837

## Government

Argentina is a federal republic. The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them.
